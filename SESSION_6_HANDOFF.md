### 🔧 Development Workflow
```bash
# Make changes in docs/ folder
cd /Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/space-simulator-ev

# Test locally
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Browse to http://localhost:8000/docs/

# Deploy updates
git add .
git commit -m "Update: description"
git push

# Changes live in ~1 minute at:
# https://lobabobloblaw.github.io/space-simulator-ev/
```

### 🐛 Known Issues
- NPCs occasionally spawn inside planets (rare)
- Performance could be optimized for more NPCs

### 🎯 Ready for Next Features
1. **Mobile Controls** - Touch/virtual joystick
2. **Save System** - localStorage progress
3. **More Planets** - Expand the universe
4. **Faction System** - Reputation with different groups
5. **Procedural Generation** - Infinite universe
6. **Multiplayer** - WebRTC peer-to-peer

### 🔑 Critical Information
- **GitHub Username**: lobabobloblaw
- **Repository**: https://github.com/lobabobloblaw/space-simulator-ev
- **Live Game**: https://lobabobloblaw.github.io/space-simulator-ev/
- **GitHub Pages**: Configured from main branch, /docs folder
- **Personal Access Token**: Already configured in git credentials

### 📊 Technical Achievements
- Pure JavaScript, no dependencies
- Modular ES6 architecture
- GitHub Pages compatible
- ~2000 lines of organized code
- 60 FPS performance
- Instant deployment pipeline

### 💡 Important Notes for Next Session
1. **ES6 imports MUST be at top of files** (before any code)
2. **All paths must be relative** (./js/ not /js/)
3. **Test locally before pushing** to avoid breaking production
4. **docs/ folder is production** - be careful with changes
5. **Use git status** before committing to check what's changing

### 🎮 How to Continue Development
The game is fully modular and ready for expansion. Each system is isolated:
- Combat: `js/systems/combat.js`
- Trading: `js/systems/trading.js`
- NPCs: `js/systems/npc.js`
- etc.

All systems are consolidated in `allSystems.js` for easy management.
