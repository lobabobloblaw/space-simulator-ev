# SESSION 9 HANDOFF - Planet Rendering & AI Landscapes

## Session Summary
This session focused on fixing planet rendering issues and adding AI-generated landscapes for planet landings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Terra Nova Regeneration Issue
- **Problem**: Terra Nova's appearance would randomly change while approaching
- **Solution**: Made planet generation deterministic using seeded random based on planet name/position
- **Files Modified**: `/docs/js/systems/proceduralPlanetRenderer.js`
- All planets now generate consistently with the same appearance every time

### 2. Added AI-Generated Landscapes
- **Integrated Pollinations.ai** for free AI landscape generation (no API key needed)
- **Custom prompts per planet**:
  - Terra Nova: Floating cities, crystalline towers, quantum bridges
  - Crimson Moon: Volcanic colony, lava flows, ore refineries
  - Ice World: Arctic research station, ice caverns, aurora
  - Mining Station: Asteroid facility, mechanical arms, industrial
- **Files Modified**: `/docs/js/systems/allSystems.js`, `/docs/index.html`
- Canvas size increased from 150x150 to 400x300 for better visuals

## Current State
✅ **AI image generation IS WORKING** - Images generate when landing
✅ Planet rendering is deterministic (no more regeneration issues)
✅ Landing mechanics work (credits, healing, refueling)
⚠️ **UI needs adjustment** - Landing overlay layout broken with larger image

## Next Session Tasks

### PRIORITY: Fix Landing UI Layout
The landing overlay needs CSS adjustments to accommodate the 400x300 planet image:

1. **Update CSS** for `#landingOverlay` and `#landingContent`
   - Adjust flex layout to handle larger planetCanvas
   - May need to reorganize panels (trading, shop, info)
   - Consider responsive design for different screen sizes

2. **Current Issues**:
   - Landing overlay may not be showing properly
   - Layout breaks with 400x300 image (was designed for 150x150)
   - Panels may overlap or be cut off

3. **Files to modify**:
   - `/docs/css/main.css` - Add proper styles for landing UI
   - `/docs/index.html` - May need structural changes to landing overlay

### Testing the AI Landscapes
```javascript
// Quick test in console
const planet = window.planets[0]; // Terra Nova
window.ship.x = planet.x + planet.radius + 40;
window.ship.y = planet.y;
// Press L to land and see the AI landscape generate
```

## Technical Details
- **Pollinations.ai URL format**: `https://image.pollinations.ai/prompt/[encoded_prompt]?width=400&height=300&nologo=true`
- Images load asynchronously with loading indicator
- Fallback to procedural graphics if API fails
- Each landing generates a NEW unique image (intentionally different each time)

## Known Issues
- Landing overlay CSS needs complete rework for larger images
- May need to adjust panel sizes and positions
- Consider making landing UI more modular/responsive

## Session Metrics
- Fixed 1 major bug (planet regeneration)
- Added 1 major feature (AI landscapes)
- ~200 lines of code added/modified
- Game remains stable and playable
