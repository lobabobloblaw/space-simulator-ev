# SESSION 38 - Save/Load Bug Investigation

## Summary
The save/load system in Galaxy Trader is still not working properly despite multiple fix attempts.

## Current Status
- ✅ Save functionality works (data is correctly saved to localStorage)
- ❌ Load functionality doesn't persist (values briefly load then revert to defaults)
- ✅ SaveSystemAdapterFixed is being imported and created
- ⚠️ Unknown error preventing proper initialization or execution

## Attempted Solutions
1. **Version 4**: Added persistent state enforcement with interceptors
2. **Version 5**: Added aggressive state enforcement with periodic checks
3. **Version 6**: Nuclear option - reload page after load (also failed)

## Root Cause Analysis
The fundamental issue appears to be one of:
1. **StateManager Proxy Issue**: The Proxy system returns new proxies on each access, breaking references
2. **Game Loop Override**: The game loop continuously updates UI with original state references
3. **Initialization Order**: SaveSystemAdapterFixed might not be fully initialized when needed

## Test Results
```javascript
// Save data correctly stored:
localStorage.getItem('galaxyTraderSave')
// Shows: credits: 4444, health: 85, etc.

// But UI shows default values:
document.getElementById('credits').textContent
// Shows: 250 (default)

// State is not updating:
window.stateManager.state.ship.credits
// Shows: 250 (should be 4444)
```

## Critical Discovery
The game shows a "SAVE DETECTED" dialog on startup that blocks initialization. When clicking LOAD:
- With nuclear reload: Page reloads but values don't persist
- Without reload: Values are briefly set then immediately overwritten

## Next Steps to Try
1. **Check for JavaScript errors** preventing SaveSystemAdapterFixed from working
2. **Bypass StateManager** and directly manipulate the ship object
3. **Hook into game loop** to continuously enforce loaded values
4. **Create new initialization flow** that loads save data BEFORE creating default state

## Files Involved
- `/docs/js/systems/SaveSystemAdapterFixed.js` - The problematic save/load adapter
- `/docs/js/main_eventbus_pure.js` - Main game file that initializes everything
- `/docs/js/core/StateManager.js` - State management with problematic Proxy system
- `/docs/js/core/GameLoop.js` - Game loop that might be overriding values

## Quick Test
```bash
cd /Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/space-simulator-ev
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000/docs/
# Press S to save, O to load
# Check if credits persist
```

## Recommendation
The EventBus refactor is complete except for this save/load bug. Consider:
1. Simplifying the StateManager to not use Proxies
2. Loading save data during initializeGameState() instead of after
3. Using a flag to prevent game loop from overriding loaded values
