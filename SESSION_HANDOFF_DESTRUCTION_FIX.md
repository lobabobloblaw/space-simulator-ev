# Galaxy Trader - Session Handoff
## Date: Current Session - Ship Destruction Fix Complete

## What Was Accomplished This Session

### âœ… Fixed Critical Ship Destruction Bug
**Problem**: Ship health went negative, creating an immortal ghost ship
**Solution**: Implemented proper destruction and respawn system

#### Changes Made:
1. **Health Clamping** (`allSystems.js`):
   - Health now clamps to 0, never goes negative
   - All damage sources properly use `Math.max(0, ship.health - damage)`

2. **Destruction State** (`allSystems.js` - updateShip function):
   - Added `ship.isDestroyed` flag
   - Ship explodes with multiple explosion effects when health <= 0
   - Movement stops completely when destroyed
   - "SHIP DESTROYED" message with respawn instructions

3. **Respawn System**:
   - Press R to respawn at last visited planet (or origin)
   - Restores full health, half shields, full fuel
   - Death penalty: -100 credits
   - Clears destroyed state and notifications

4. **Rendering Changes** (`main.js`):
   - Ship no longer renders when destroyed
   - Health bar hidden when destroyed
   - Ship completely disappears from screen

5. **NPC AI Updates** (`allSystems.js`):
   - NPCs check `!ship.isDestroyed` before targeting
   - Pirates won't attack destroyed players
   - Traders won't flee from destroyed players
   - Patrols ignore destroyed ships

6. **Safety Features**:
   - HUD shows 0% health minimum (not negative)
   - Autosave disabled when ship is destroyed
   - Proper state management during destruction

## Current Game State

### âœ… Working Features
- **Ship destruction and respawn** - Properly handles death/rebirth cycle
- **Cyberpunk UI** - Clean monochrome + cyan accent design
- **Combat system** - NPCs fight each other and player
- **Trading economy** - Buy low, sell high across 4 planets
- **Shop upgrades** - Weapons, shields, engines, cargo
- **Mission system** - Sequential objectives with rewards
- **Save/Load** - S to save, O to load (localStorage)
- **Touch controls** - Virtual joystick for mobile (use ?touch=true)
- **Sound system** - M to toggle audio effects

### ðŸ”§ Known Issues
1. **Planets too small** - Need larger size and atmospheric effects (as user mentioned)
2. **Visual polish** - Could use more particle effects, trails
3. **Balance** - Early game might be too punishing without weapons

## Technical Details

### Critical Constants
- **Canvas Height**: `window.innerHeight - 150` (110px HUD + 40px padding)
- **HUD Height**: 110px with 20px bottom margin
- **ES6 Modules**: All imports must be at top of files
- **Relative Paths**: Use `./js/` not `/js/`

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Local testing (Terminal 1)
cd /Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/space-simulator-ev/docs
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Browse to http://localhost:8000

# Git deployment (Terminal 2 - SEPARATE TAB!)
cd /Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/space-simulator-ev
git add -A
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin main
# Wait 2-5 minutes for GitHub Pages
```

### Live URLs
- **Local**: http://localhost:8000
- **Production**: https://lobabobloblaw.github.io/space-simulator-ev/
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/lobabobloblaw/space-simulator-ev

## User Preferences (IMPORTANT)
1. **Be concise** - User prefers brevity
2. **Terminal usage** - Use `do script 'command' in front window` for existing terminals
3. **Spawn new terminals** - Create new Terminal windows for git operations
4. **Add pauses** - Wait between OS operations (use delay in AppleScript)
5. **Ask about operations** - Suggest helpful operations

## Next Priorities (User Feedback)

### ðŸ”´ High Priority - Core Visual Improvements
**User specifically said**: "save slots, like mobile controls, are things for a future version"
**User wants**: "the planet sizes need to increase, and there needs to be some manner of atmospheric visual effects"

1. **Larger Planets**:
   - Current radius: 40-80
   - Should be: 100-200+ for more imposing presence
   - Currently in `gameData.js`

2. **Better Atmospheric Effects**:
   - Current: Basic gradient glows
   - Needed: Layered atmospheric halos, heat shimmer, clouds
   - See planet rendering in `main.js` (~line 350-500)

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority
3. **More Visual Polish**:
   - Ship engine trails
   - Damage sparks
   - Better explosions
   - Weapon impact effects

4. **Core Gameplay**:
   - More interesting AI behaviors
   - Dynamic faction relationships
   - Random events

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority (Future Version)
- Multiple save slots
- Procedural generation
- Quest chains
- Network multiplayer

## Session Summary
Fixed critical ship destruction bug where health went negative. Ship now properly explodes at 0 health with respawn system. User emphasized that fundamental visual improvements (bigger planets, atmosphere) are more important than new features like save slots.
