# SESSION 36 HANDOFF - Save/Load System Status

## Current Issue
The save/load system is STILL NOT WORKING properly in Galaxy Trader. 

## What Was Attempted
1. Created `SaveSystemAdapterFixed.js` with proper StateManager integration
2. Added forced DOM updates via `forceUIUpdate()` method
3. Added multiple delayed UI updates to ensure values stick
4. Added extensive debug logging

## Diagnosis
The save/load system components are:
- ✅ SaveSystemAdapterFixed is being created and initialized
- ✅ Events are being properly received (GAME_SAVE and GAME_LOAD)
- ✅ Save data is correctly written to localStorage
- ✅ Load data is correctly read from localStorage
- ❌ **State updates are not persisting or UI is being overwritten**

## The Core Problem
The game loop (in `GameLoop.js`) is constantly calling:
```javascript
onUpdate: (deltaTime) => {
    // Update HUD
    eventBus.emit(GameEvents.UI_UPDATE, { ship: state.ship });
}
```

This is overwriting our loaded values with the original state values. The StateManager's proxy system isn't properly updating the underlying state when we load.

## Next Steps to Fix
1. **Fix StateManager updates**: The issue is in how we update the ship state. Instead of updating properties individually, we need to replace the entire ship object:
   ```javascript
   // Instead of:
   Object.keys(data.ship).forEach(key => {
       state.ship[key] = data.ship[key];
   });
   
   // Try:
   this.stateManager.state.ship = { ...this.stateManager.state.ship, ...data.ship };
   ```

2. **Alternative approach**: Emit a special GAME_STATE_LOADED event that the game loop recognizes and uses to refresh its reference to the state.

3. **Nuclear option**: Reload the entire game after loading save data:
   ```javascript
   handleLoad() {
       // ... load data to localStorage ...
       window.location.reload(); // Force reload to pick up saved state
   }
   ```

## Test Instructions
```javascript
// In browser console at http://localhost:8000/docs/
// 1. Save game
window.dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent('keydown', { key: 's' }));

// 2. Modify save
const data = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('galaxyTraderSave'));
data.ship.credits = 9999;
localStorage.setItem('galaxyTraderSave', JSON.stringify(data));

// 3. Load game
window.dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent('keydown', { key: 'o' }));

// 4. Check - should show 9999 but shows 250
document.getElementById('credits').textContent;
```

- `/docs/js/systems/SaveSystemAdapterFixed.js` - The save/load adapter
- `/docs/js/core/StateManager.js` - State management with Proxy
- `/docs/js/core/GameLoop.js` - Game loop that updates UI
- `/docs/js/main_eventbus_pure.js` - Main game file

## Critical Note
The EventBus refactor is complete and working EXCEPT for this save/load bug. Once this is fixed, the refactor will have full feature parity with the original game.
