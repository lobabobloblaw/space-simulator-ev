# Session Handoff — Template

Use this template at the end of each session. Copy into a new file named with the next session number (e.g., `SESSION_54_HANDOFF.md`). Keep it concise and actionable for the next agent.

## Summary

## Changes
- Files modified (paths) and short description of each change.
- Feature flags/toggles affected.

## Verification Steps
- Exact steps to validate locally (server command, URLs, toggles).
- What to look for (expected visuals/behavior; perf notes).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Bullet list mapping to this session’s goals and what passed.

## Open Issues / Follow-ups
- Known gaps or edge cases.
- Any risks or tradeoffs taken.

## Next Session Plan
- 3–6 concrete, ordered steps.

## Context / Links
- Key internal docs (e.g., `INTERNAL_DEV_DOCS/RENDERING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `SESSION_CADENCE.md`).
- Any related fixtures (`docs/test/...`).

## Debug / Toggles Used (reset before end)
- e.g., `TC_SHOW_PATH`, `TC_WARM_MS`, `DEBUG_SPRITES`, `TC_FX`, `TC_FORCE`.

## Build / Version Notes (optional)
- Any build tag or module freshness note that helps QA verify they’re on the latest.
