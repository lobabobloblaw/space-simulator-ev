# Internal Dev Notes

This folder collects live, session-specific prompts, decisions, and quick references to accelerate the next agent. These notes supplement (not replace) `INTERNAL_DEV_DOCS/` and the `SESSION_*_HANDOFF.md` files.

Contents:
- `NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md` — a thorough, ready-to-send prompt for the next session.
- `DECISIONS.md` — key decisions taken this session and their rationale.
- `QUICK_TOGGLES.md` — frequently used QA/debug toggles and safe defaults.

Always keep toggles OFF by default. Use these notes in conjunction with `SESSION_CADENCE.md`.
