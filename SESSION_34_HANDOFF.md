# SESSION 34 HANDOFF - Refactoring Verification & Validation

## Project: Galaxy Trader - Space Trading & Combat Game
**Date:** August 18, 2025  
**Session Focus:** Verify all original functionality exists in Pure EventBus refactor
**Current Status:** âœ… Deployed to GitHub Pages - Needs comprehensive verification

## Critical Context
The game has been completely refactored from mixed architecture to Pure EventBus pattern. Your mission is to verify that **ALL** functionality from the original game exists and works correctly in the refactored version.

## COMPARISON METHODOLOGY

For each system, test in BOTH versions:
1. **Original:** `/docs/index_old_backup.html`
2. **Refactored:** `/docs/index.html`

Look for:
- Identical behavior
- Same feel/responsiveness
- Matching visual effects
- Consistent game balance

## KNOWN WORKING FEATURES (Already Verified)
- âœ… Pure EventBus architecture functional
- âœ… Weaponless start (fixed in Session 33)
- âœ… Ship speed improvements (3x thrust, 78% faster max)
- âœ… GitHub Pages deployment working
- âœ… Basic gameplay loop intact

## RED FLAGS - What Would Indicate Problems
- ðŸš¨ Player starts with weapons (should be empty)
- ðŸš¨ NPCs not spawning or behaving oddly
- ðŸš¨ Trades not calculating correctly
- ðŸš¨ Upgrades not applying effects
- ðŸš¨ Save/Load corrupting state
- ðŸš¨ Memory leaks (performance degradation over time)
- ðŸš¨ Event handlers not cleaning up
- ðŸš¨ Missing particle effects or sounds

## Code Architecture Notes

### Pure EventBus Pattern
All systems communicate via events:
```javascript
// Example: Firing weapon
EventBus.emit('player:fire', { weapon: currentWeapon });

// System listens and responds
EventBus.on('player:fire', (data) => {
    // Create projectile
    EventBus.emit('projectile:create', {...});
});
```

### System Files to Review if Issues Found
- `/docs/js/EventBus.js` - Central event system
- `/docs/js/main_eventbus_pure.js` - Main game loop
- `/docs/js/systems/allSystems.js` - System initialization
- `/docs/js/systems/CombatSystem.js` - Weapon/damage logic
- `/docs/js/systems/NPCSystem.js` - AI behaviors
- `/docs/js/systems/TradingSystem.js` - Economy logic

## Performance Metrics to Track
- FPS should stay near 60
- Memory usage should stabilize (not continuously grow)
- No console errors during gameplay
- Event queue shouldn't build up

## Final Validation Goals
1. **100% Feature Parity:** Every feature in original works in refactored
2. **No Regressions:** Nothing that worked is now broken
3. **Performance Equal or Better:** Refactored version runs smoothly
4. **Code Cleanliness:** Pure EventBus pattern maintained throughout

## Quick Commands Reference
```bash
# Start local server
cd /Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/space-simulator-ev
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Git operations
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "message"
git push origin main

# View console in Chrome
Cmd+Option+J (Mac)
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 10 core systems verified working
- [ ] All 5 test scenarios pass
- [ ] No functionality lost from original
- [ ] Performance acceptable (steady 60 FPS)
- [ ] No console errors during normal play
- [ ] Both versions feel identical to play
