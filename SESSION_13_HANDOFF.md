# SESSION 13 HANDOFF - NPC Behavior & Asteroid Rendering Fixes

## Session Summary
This session focused on fixing NPC fleeing behavior to be more realistic and fixing asteroid rendering to show irregular rocky chunks instead of circles.

## Changes Made

### 1. NPC Fleeing Behavior Improvements
- **Problem**: NPCs were "wiggling like fish" when fleeing, moving sideways while trying to escape
- **Solution**: 
  - NPCs now turn to face escape direction BEFORE thrusting
  - Added 2.5x turn speed multiplier when fleeing for quick escapes
  - Implemented partial thrust (50% power) when partially aligned (30-60°)
  - Full thrust only when properly aligned (<30°)
  - Removed zigzag evasion pattern completely
- **Files Changed**: `/docs/js/systems/allSystems.js`

### 2. Asteroid Rendering Fix
- **Problem**: Some asteroids appeared as round gray circles instead of irregular chunks
- **Solution**:
  - Each asteroid now has unique `shapePoints` array with 8 random vertices
  - Asteroid fragments from destruction also get unique irregular shapes
  - Added subtle outline stroke for better visual definition
  - Proper per-asteroid rotation tracking
- **Files Changed**: `/docs/js/main.js`, `/docs/js/systems/allSystems.js`

## Current State
✅ **Game FULLY WORKING** with all features operational
✅ **NPCs flee realistically** - turn and burn instead of wiggling
✅ **Asteroids look like rocks** - irregular chunks with unique shapes
✅ **Performance stable** - no issues with the changes

## Technical Details

### NPC Fleeing Logic
```javascript
// Mark as fleeing for faster turning
npc.isFleeing = true;

// Only thrust when facing the escape direction
if (Math.abs(angleDiff) < Math.PI / 6) {  // 30 degrees
    shouldThrust = true;  // Full power escape!
} else if (Math.abs(angleDiff) < Math.PI / 3) {  // 60 degrees
    shouldThrust = true;
    npc.thrustPower = 0.5;  // Half power while turning
} else {
    shouldThrust = false;  // Just turn, don't thrust yet
}

// Much faster turning when fleeing
const turnSpeed = npc.isFleeing ? npc.turnSpeed * 2.5 : npc.turnSpeed;
```

### Asteroid Shape Generation
```javascript
// Generate unique shape for each asteroid
const shapePoints = [];
for (let j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
    shapePoints.push(0.7 + Math.random() * 0.6); // Random variance 0.7-1.3
}
```

## Testing Checklist
1. ✅ Engage pirates near patrol ships - pirates turn and flee properly
2. ✅ Attack traders - they turn away before escaping
3. ✅ Destroy large asteroids - fragments are irregular chunks
4. ✅ All asteroids appear as jagged rocks, not circles
5. ✅ Performance remains smooth with all changes

## Next Session Priorities

### 1. Performance Optimization
- Image caching for planet landscapes
- Optimize render calls for large battles
- Consider LOD system for distant objects

### 2. Gameplay Expansion
- More planet types and unique characteristics
- Faction reputation system
- Quest chains with branching paths
- Boss encounters with special AI

### 3. UI/UX Polish
- Settings menu with graphics/audio options
- Galaxy map for navigation
- Achievement/milestone system
- Better inventory management UI

### 4. Combat Enhancements
- More weapon types and effects
- Ship special abilities
- Combat damage states (system failures)
- Tactical combat options

## Known Issues
- None critical
- Minor: AI landscape generation takes 2-3 seconds
- Minor: No persistent image caching for planets

## Recent Git Commits
- "Fix NPC fleeing behavior and asteroid rendering"
  - NPCs turn before fleeing
  - Asteroids have unique irregular shapes
  - Better visual definition for space rocks
