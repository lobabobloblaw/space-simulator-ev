# Space Simulator - Escape Velocity Style
## Project Documentation for Future Claude Sessions

### Project Overview
This is a browser-based 2D space trading and combat game inspired by the classic Escape Velocity series. Built entirely in vanilla HTML5/JavaScript using Canvas API, it features real-time space combat, trading economics, ship upgrades, and NPC AI systems.

**Current Version:** 1.2.0
**Last Updated:** August 16, 2025 (Session 3 - Enhanced)
**Developer:** Alex Voigt (with Claude assistance)
**File Location:** `/Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/space-simulator-ev/space-simulator.html`
**File Size:** 3,086 lines (single HTML file)

### How to Run
Simply open `space-simulator.html` in any modern web browser. No dependencies or build process required.

### Game Controls
- **Arrow Keys/WAD:** Turn and thrust forward (no reverse)
- **F:** Fire weapon (if armed)
- **Q:** Switch weapons (if multiple owned)
- **Space:** Brake
- **L:** Land at nearby planet/station (clears all NPCs)
- **1-4:** Station interface navigation (when docked)

### Recent Major Changes (v1.2.0 - August 16, 2025, Session 3 Extended)

#### Major Features Added âœ¨
- **SOUND SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED:** Complete Web Audio API integration
  - Unique weapon sounds for each type (mining, rapid, plasma)
  - Soft acceleration sound when thrusting
  - Shield hit effects and explosions
  - Pickup collection sounds
  - Landing/docking sound
  - Mute toggle with 'M' key

- **Major Combat Rebalance:** 
  - Patrol damage reduced 80% (30â†’6), fire rate 3x slower
  - Pirate health doubled (40â†’80), damage increased 67%
  - Result: Space battles last 15-30 seconds instead of 2-3 seconds
- **Improved AI:** Pirates evade patrols, patrols give up failed pursuits
- **NPC Movement:** Less repetitive with random patterns and drift

### Recent Major Changes (v1.1.0 - August 2025, Session 1)

- **Ship Visual Diversity:** Each NPC type has unique, recognizable appearance
- **Player Starts Unarmed:** Must trade to buy first weapon (150 credits)
- **Slower Starting Ship:** Reduced speed (0.45), thrust (0.004), and turn rate (0.012)
- **Enhanced Patrol Ships:** 3x player speed (1.4), 150 HP, 30 damage weapons, intimidating visuals
- **Landing Clears NPCs:** All ships removed when docking (tactical reset feature)
- **No Reverse Thrust:** Removed for both player and NPCs
- **Enhanced Patrol AI:** Patrols now protect traders from pirates, creating dynamic law enforcement
- **Fixed Bugs:** Alert dialog issue, fuel system, custom toast notifications

### Completed Features

#### Core Mechanics âœ…
- **Physics-based movement:** Newtonian physics with momentum conservation (no reverse thrust)
- **Camera system:** Follows player smoothly

### Development Notes for Next Claude

#### Current State
The game is fully playable with a well-balanced difficulty curve. The v1.1.1 update significantly improved combat balance and NPC interactions.

**Core Gameplay Loop:**
1. Start unarmed â†’ trade commodities between stations
2. Buy mining laser (150 credits) â†’ mine asteroids for ore or hunt pirates
3. Upgrade weapons and ship systems with profits
4. Navigate dynamic NPC ecosystem (patrols vs pirates vs traders)

**Current Balance (v1.1.1):**
- **Patrols:** Fast but inaccurate, 6 damage, 20 cooldown, 20-80% accuracy
- **Pirates:** Tanky and evasive, 80 HP, 10 damage, smart AI
- **Combat:** Extended battles (15-30 seconds), pirates can escape/win
- **Economy:** Balanced around 250 starting credits, weapons 150-1200

**What Works Well:**
- Tutorial hints guide new players
- Asteroid mining provides alternative income
- NPC battles create emergent gameplay
- Trading system encourages exploration

**What Needs Work:**
- Save system for longer sessions
- Sound effects for immersion
- Mission system for goals
- More varied content

#### Architecture Decisions
- **Vanilla JS:** No frameworks to keep it simple and portable
- **Canvas 2D:** Chose over WebGL for simplicity
- **Single file:** Everything in one HTML file for easy sharing
- **No build process:** Direct browser execution

#### Where to Focus Next (Session 3 Analysis)
1. **Sound effects** - Would transform the experience (Web Audio API)
2. **2-3 Quick missions** - Simple goals for 10-15 min session
3. **Fix star rendering** - Complete wrapping calculation, add culling
4. **Pirate loot drops** - Immediate reward feedback
5. **Achievement popups** - Quick dopamine hits for milestones

**Note:** Save system deprioritized since game is designed for short sessions

#### Code Conventions
- Functions use camelCase
- Global constants in UPPER_CASE (should refactor current code)
- Comments explain why, not what
- Draw functions separated from update logic

#### Testing Checklist
- [ ] All weapons fire correctly
- [ ] NPCs spawn and behave appropriately  
- [ ] Trading profits are balanced
- [ ] Upgrades apply correctly
- [ ] Landing/docking works at all stations
- [ ] Landing clears all NPCs properly
- [ ] Fuel system prevents thrust at 0
- [ ] Game over triggers properly
- [ ] Performance stays above 30 FPS

### Session 3 Code Analysis Summary

#### File Structure
- **Lines:** 3,086 total
- **Main sections:**
  - Lines 1-385: HTML/CSS (includes HUD, landing overlay)
  - Lines 386-840: Initial game setup (objects, NPCs, commodities)
  - Lines 841-2835: Core game logic (update functions, AI)
  - Lines 2836-3066: Rendering functions (draw, HUD updates)
  - Lines 3067-3086: Game loop and initialization

#### Key Functions Location
- `updateShip()`: Line ~900
- `updateNPCs()`: Line ~1200 (most complex function, handles all AI)
- `fireProjectile()`: Line ~1900
- `checkLanding()`: Line ~2200
- `drawShip()`: Line ~2850
- `gameLoop()`: Line ~3050

#### Performance Hotspots Identified
1. **drawStars()**: Draws 500+ stars every frame without culling
2. **updateNPCs()**: Complex AI calculations for each NPC
3. **Collision detection**: O(nÂ²) checks between projectiles and entities

### Quick Start for Development

1. Open the HTML file in browser
2. Open browser DevTools console
3. Key objects to inspect:
   - `ship` - player state
   - `npcShips` - array of NPCs
   - `planets` - station data
   - `commodities` - trade goods
   - `npcTypes` - NPC configurations

### Debug Commands (paste in console)

#### Session 3 Additions

// Give credits
ship.credits = 10000;

// Full health/shields
ship.health = ship.maxHealth;
ship.shield = ship.maxShield;

// Give first weapon
ship.weapons = [{type: "mining", damage: 2, cooldown: 35}];

// Teleport to coordinates
ship.x = 0; ship.y = 0;

// Teleport to first planet
ship.x = planets[0].x + 50;
ship.y = planets[0].y + 50;

// Spawn specific NPC
spawnNPC(); // Random type

// Clear all NPCs
npcShips.length = 0;

// God mode
ship.maxHealth = 9999;
ship.health = 9999;

// Instant rich (for testing purchases)
ship.credits = 99999;

// Give all weapons
ship.weapons = [
    {type: "mining", damage: 2, cooldown: 35},
    {type: "rapid", damage: 5, cooldown: 12},
    {type: "plasma", damage: 20, cooldown: 35}
];

// Max out ship
ship.maxShield = 50;
ship.shield = 50;
ship.engineLevel = 3;
ship.thrust = 0.008;
ship.maxSpeed = 0.72;
ship.cargoCapacity = 30;

// Skip tutorial
ship.tutorialStage = 'done';

// Performance monitoring
let fps = 0;
let lastTime = performance.now();
function monitorFPS() {
    const now = performance.now();
    fps = Math.round(1000 / (now - lastTime));
    lastTime = now;
    console.log('FPS:', fps);
    requestAnimationFrame(monitorFPS);
}
monitorFPS();

// Max speed
ship.maxSpeed = 2.0;
ship.thrust = 0.02;
```

## Message for Next Claude Instance

Hello! You're working on a space trading/combat game inspired by Escape Velocity. The game is functional and playable, designed for 10-15 minute sessions.

### Current State (v1.1.2)
- **File:** Single 3,086-line HTML file at `/Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/space-simulator-ev/space-simulator.html`
- **Architecture:** Intentionally single-file, no build process, vanilla JS + Canvas
- **Gameplay:** Complete trading, combat, and upgrade systems working well
- **Session Length:** Designed for 10-15 minute play sessions (save system not critical)

### What I Fixed in Session 3
1. **Tutorial CSS:** Was completely missing, now properly styled
2. **Canvas Height:** Fixed inconsistency (was 140px/120px, now 100px everywhere)
3. **Documentation:** Thoroughly analyzed all code, documented structure

### Critical Issues Still Present
1. **Star Rendering Bug:** Line ~2835 has incomplete wrapping calculation
2. **Performance:** Drawing 500+ stars without viewport culling
3. **No Sound:** Completely silent (biggest impact opportunity)

### Alex's Preferences (Important!)
- **Single file approach:** Keep everything in one HTML file
- **Simplicity:** No frameworks, no build process
- **Quick sessions:** Game is meant for 10-15 minutes, not hours
- **Brevity:** Don't be verbose, focus on essentials

### Immediate Priorities for Next Session
1. **Sound Effects:** Use Web Audio API for immediate impact
   - Engine hum (scales with speed)
   - Weapon sounds (different per type)
   - Shield hits, explosions
   - UI sounds (landing, purchasing)

2. **2-3 Simple Missions:** Add goals to the sandbox
   - Delivery: Take X commodity from A to B
   - Bounty: Kill 3 pirates
   - Trader: Earn 500 credits from trading

3. **Fix Star Bug:** Complete the wrapping calculation
   ```javascript
   // Line ~2835 needs completion
   const wrappedY = ((y % canvas.height) + canvas.height) % canvas.height;
   ```

4. **Pirate Loot:** Make pirates drop cargo/credits

### Code Structure Quick Reference
- **Game Loop:** Line 3050-3066
- **Player Update:** Line 900-1100
- **NPC AI:** Line 1200-1900 (complex, handles all behaviors)
- **Combat:** Line 1900-2100
- **Landing/Trading:** Line 2200-2500
- **Rendering:** Line 2850-3050

### Performance Notes
- Game runs at steady 60 FPS on modern hardware
- Main bottleneck: star rendering (500+ stars)
- NPC AI is complex but handles 12 ships fine
- Collision detection could use spatial partitioning if expanded

### What NOT to Do
- Don't add a save system (game is too short)
- Don't break into multiple files (Alex prefers single file)
- Don't add frameworks or dependencies
- Don't make the game longer/grindier

Good luck! The game is in great shape - just needs polish for those 10-15 minute sessions.
