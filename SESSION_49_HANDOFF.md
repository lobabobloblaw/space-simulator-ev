# Session 49 Handoff — Galaxy Trader (EventBus/Pure)

Date: 2025-08-23

Summary
- Deployment: Clean GitHub Pages to serve only `docs/` (restored Branch: main /docs). Decluttered repo root; added `docs/robots.txt`.
- Radio/Audio:
  - Fixed chiptune loader paths for GitHub Pages subpath; added worklet shim `docs/js/vendor/chiptune-3/chiptune3.worklet.min.js` to resolve AbortError.
  - Removed broken local chiptune2 stubs; load local chiptune-3 first; CDN last.
  - Mute (`M`) now pauses/resumes music too (not just SFX).
  - Added radio start offset (default 2.4s) so tuning cuts straight into audio.
  - Tuning static: consistent harsher texture, hard gate cutoff, and reduced level (~65% softer). Precise handoff for clean snap.
  - First-play fix: wait for tracker `onInitialized` before `load(...)`; resume AudioContext on play.
- UI/Death state:
  - On `ship.death`: dim HUD, disable radio controls, show SIGNAL LOST; pause music.
  - Targeting clears on death; target viewport shows OFFLINE overlay.
  - On respawn: restore HUD and radio state.
- Tutorial: Converted “WARNING: UNARMED” to a small status line above the left stats.

Files touched (key)
- `docs/js/systems/AudioSystem.js` (loader, M key behavior, tuning, start offset, init guards)
- `docs/js/vendor/chiptune-3/chiptune3.worklet.min.js` (shim)
- `docs/js/systems/UISystem.js` (death/respawn UI, tutorial hint)
- `docs/js/systems/RenderSystem.js` (target viewport OFFLINE + death guard)
- `docs/js/systems/TargetingSystem.js` (clear on death)
- `docs/css/main.css` (dim styles, tutorial hint relocation)

How to run
- Local: `cd /Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/space-simulator-ev && python3 -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000/docs/`.
- GitHub Pages: Repo Settings → Pages → Source: Branch `main`, Folder `/docs`.

Quick tests
- Radio: Play/Next/Prev; verify static snaps to audio at ~2.4s, M mutes/unmutes all audio.
- Death: Set `state.ship.health=0; state.ship.isDestroyed=true; eventBus.emit('ship.death')` → HUD dims, radio disabled, target viewport OFFLINE.
- Respawn: Press `R` → HUD back to normal.

Notes
- The loader prefers local chiptune-3. CDN attempts are retained but not required. If desired, we can add a “local-only” flag to skip CDN probes entirely.

Next session (50): Sprite Integration
- Implement sprite rendering for ships and effects alongside existing vector/silhouette system.
- Keep architecture: Pure EventBus, no globals, state in StateManager, systems communicate via events.
- High-level plan below; see NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md for details.

---

Proposed Plan for Sprites (overview)
1) Asset pipeline: define sprite atlas format and loader under `docs/js/assets/` via a simple manifest.
2) RenderSystem: add sprite batch path + atlas UV sampling; maintain silhouette fallback.
3) Systems: allow ship types to reference sprite sheet frames; event-driven transitions (explosions, thrusters).
4) Performance: basic culling + optional resolution scaling per quality level.
5) Tooling: small helper to pack sprites (optional if starting with prepacked PNG).

Acceptance
- Ships can render from a sprite atlas; silhouettes remain available for modes that prefer them.
- No new globals; events only. Existing save/load remains compatible.
