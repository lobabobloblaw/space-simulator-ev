Session 66 Handoff

Summary
- HiDPI/DPR: Verified crispness; canvases sized by DPR; `withWorld/withScreen` apply DPR transforms.
- TargetCam: In-canvas gradient + crosshair; pixel-snapped center; correct at 80/70/60px snaps regardless of start size; faint static always on; FX overlays retained.
- Panel canvases: absolute fill + display:block; outline (not border) to avoid center drift; ResizeObserver + rounding re-sizes backing stores on snap.
- Security/A11y: Added CSP meta, ARIA live region; replaced high-traffic innerHTML with safe DOM building (landing details, trading lists).
- Assets: Added LRU cap for atlas frame canvases; planet sprites manifest + overrides retained; player-only `spriteId` override works.
- UI: Top-left logo overlay with version tag (`GameConstants.META.VERSION`).

Acceptance (this session)
- TargetCam centered at 80/70/60px across start sizes; no ring/gradient drift.
- Static present at low intensity at all times; FX boosts during transitions.
- No focus ring on the action canvas; logo overlay visible top-left with version.
- HUD weapon shows EQUIP when unarmed; shield shows EQUIP when zero.

Known/Watchlist
- If any TargetCam drift persists on specific DPRs, consider a single-frame diagnostic overlay to compare computed center with canvas midpoint and adjust compensation.
- Minimap still uses CSS crosshair/gradient; consider mirroring in-canvas draw for perfect parity with TargetCam.
- Debris sizes reduced; can revisit lifetimes or alpha fade if density feels high on busy scenes.

Next Session Plan (proposed)
1) Final TargetCam QA: add optional diagnostic dot toggle (e.g., `window.TC_CENTER_DOT = true`) and confirm across DPRs.
2) Unify minimap: draw its crosshair/background in-canvas using same centering logic.
3) Planet sprite pipeline polish: sample images + manifest guidance in repo; optional URL params for per-planet swaps.
4) Security/A11y follow-ups: expand ARIA labeling; sanitize remaining ad-hoc HTML insertions if any.
5) Version tooling: optional build step to stamp `GameConstants.META.VERSION` from Git tag/date.

Toggles
- Keep diagnostics OFF by default. TargetCam FX only when `window.TC_FX = true`.
- QA: `window.USE_PLANET_SPRITES` (sprites vs procedural), `window.TC_SHOW_PATH` (path label).
