# Current State

## ✅ WORKING
The game is now running with a modular architecture! You can:
- Fly around with W/A/S/D controls
- See planets and the ship rendered
- HUD updates correctly  
- Tutorial system works

## 🚧 PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
These systems need to be completed in `js/systems/allSystems.js`:
- `updateNPCs()` - NPC AI and spawning
- `spawnNPC()` - NPC creation logic
- `updateAsteroids()` - Asteroid physics and mining
- `updatePickups()` - Pickup collection
- Trading system functions
- Shop/upgrade system

## 📁 FILE STRUCTURE
```
js/
├── main.js              # Main entry point (working)
├── data/
│   └── gameData.js      # All game configuration
└── systems/
    └── allSystems.js    # All game systems (needs completion)
```

## 🎮 TO RESTORE FULL FUNCTIONALITY
1. Complete the stub functions in `allSystems.js`
2. Copy the missing logic from `space-simulator.html`
3. Test each system as you add it

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS
1. Add NPC spawning and AI
2. Implement asteroid mining
3. Complete trading interface
4. Add weapon shop functionality
5. Test combat system

The foundation is solid - the game loop, rendering, and basic systems are working!
