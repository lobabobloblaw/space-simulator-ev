## WeaponSystem Architecture

### Key Features
- **Projectile Management:** Creates and updates all projectiles
- **Collision Detection:** Checks hits on ships, NPCs, asteroids
- **Damage System:** Applies damage with shield/health logic
- **Weapon Types:** Supports laser, rapid, plasma, mining weapons
- **Event Integration:** Uses EventBus for all combat events
- **Sound Coordination:** Triggers audio events for weapon sounds

### Event Integration
The WeaponSystem listens for:
- `WEAPON_FIRE` - Fires a projectile
- `INPUT_SWITCH_WEAPON` - Switches active weapon
- `PHYSICS_COLLISION` - Handles projectile hits
- `ENTITY_DESTROYED` - Cleans up projectiles from destroyed entities

The WeaponSystem emits:
- `WEAPON_FIRED` - When projectile is created
- `PHYSICS_PROJECTILE_HIT` - When projectile hits target
- `SHIELD_HIT` - When shields absorb damage
- `SHIP_DAMAGE` - When hull takes damage
- `NPC_DEATH` - When NPC is destroyed

## How to Start Next Session

### 1. Read Documentation (in order)
```bash
cd /Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/space-simulator-ev
cat UNIVERSAL_PRIMER.txt        # Environment setup
cat QUICK_REFERENCE.md          # Current status  
cat SESSION_21_FINAL_HANDOFF.md # This file
```

### 2. Start Server
```bash
cd /Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/space-simulator-ev
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### 3. Test Game Works
```bash
open http://localhost:8000/docs/
# Click "NEW GAME" 
# Press W to thrust
# Press F to fire - projectiles should appear
# Press Q to switch weapons (if you have multiple)
# Engage NPCs in combat
```

### 4. Check Migration Progress
```bash
open http://localhost:8000/docs/diagnostic.html
# Should show 87.5% complete (7 of 8 systems)
```

## Next Task: Extract SpawnSystem ⭐ FINAL SYSTEM

The SpawnSystem is the FINAL system to extract. It's the most complex and handles:
- NPC spawning logic
- NPC AI behavior (pirates, traders, patrols)
- Asteroid generation
- Pickup creation from destroyed entities
- Spawn timing and limits
- Warp effects for arrivals/departures

### Extraction Strategy for SpawnSystem:
1. Create `/docs/js/systems/SpawnSystem.js`
2. Extract `spawnNPC()` and `updateNPCs()` functions
3. Extract asteroid generation and update logic
4. Include pickup spawning from destroyed entities
5. Use EventBus pattern like other systems
6. Keep old functions in allSystems.js for compatibility
7. Test NPC behavior, spawning, and AI thoroughly
8. Progress will reach 100% (8 of 8 systems)

### SpawnSystem Location in allSystems.js:
- `spawnNPC()` function (extensive)
- `updateNPCs()` function (VERY large - handles all AI)
- `updateAsteroids()` function
- `updatePickups()` function
- NPC behavior logic (aggressive, passive, lawful)
- Spawn timing management

## Known Issues & Warnings

### ⚠️ Compatibility Layer
The WeaponSystem exists in two places:
1. `/docs/js/systems/WeaponSystem.js` - New EventBus version (not used yet)
2. `/docs/js/systems/allSystems.js` - Old version (currently active)

This is intentional! Main.js still uses direct function calls. Once all systems are migrated, we'll update main.js to use EventBus throughout.

### ⚠️ SpawnSystem Complexity
The SpawnSystem is BY FAR the most complex system:
- Over 800 lines of NPC AI logic
- Complex behavior patterns for different NPC types
- Interaction between pirates, patrols, and traders
- Player reputation system affecting NPC behavior
- This will be the most challenging extraction

### ⚠️ Testing Required
Always test after changes:
1. Game loads without errors
2. Combat works (F to fire)
3. Weapon switching works (Q key)
4. Projectiles hit targets
5. Damage is applied correctly
6. NPCs can fire at player
7. Diagnostic shows correct progress

## Success Metrics for This Session
✅ WeaponSystem file created and complete  
✅ EventBus pattern properly implemented  
✅ Game remains fully playable  
✅ All combat mechanics working  
✅ Progress increased to 87.5%  
✅ Documentation updated  

## Architecture Notes

### Event-Driven Combat
The WeaponSystem demonstrates the power of the event-driven architecture:
```javascript
// Firing a weapon triggers a cascade of events:
WEAPON_FIRE → creates projectile → WEAPON_FIRED → plays sound
→ projectile moves → PHYSICS_PROJECTILE_HIT → applies damage
→ SHIELD_HIT or SHIP_DAMAGE → updates UI → possible ENTITY_DESTROYED
```

### Weapon Types Structure
```javascript
weaponTypes = {
    laser: { type: "laser", damage: 10, cooldown: 15, speed: 2 },
    rapid: { type: "rapid", damage: 5, cooldown: 5, speed: 3 },
    plasma: { type: "plasma", damage: 20, cooldown: 30, speed: 1.5 },
    mining: { type: "mining", damage: 3, cooldown: 10, speed: 2 }
}
```

## Final Notes

THE REFACTOR IS NEARLY COMPLETE! With 87.5% done, only the SpawnSystem remains. This is a major milestone:

- **7 of 8 systems** have been successfully extracted
- The game has remained **fully playable** throughout
- The pattern is **well-established** and proven
- Each system follows the **same architecture**

The SpawnSystem will be the most challenging extraction due to its complexity, but once complete, the refactor will be at 100%. After that, the final step is updating main.js to fully utilize the EventBus and removing the compatibility layers from allSystems.js.

This has been an incredibly successful refactoring project. The modular architecture is clean, maintainable, and extensible. The EventBus pattern provides excellent decoupling between systems.

**ONE MORE SYSTEM TO GO!**
