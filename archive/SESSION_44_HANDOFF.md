# Session 44 Handoff — Galaxy Trader

Live build: https://lobabobloblaw.github.io/space-simulator-ev/
Local: `python3 -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000/docs/`

## What Changed This Session

- Planet landing visual polish
  - Added signal processing intro in `UISystem.drawPlanetVisual()`:
    - Film grain overlay (existing), new scanline/rolling bar overlay, plus subtle chromatic offset during fade-in
    - Central pixelated “processing” band fades out as the HQ image resolves
  - No changes to provider logic or quality caps; UI provider toggles removed to avoid user confusion

- Ship visuals overhaul
  - New `docs/js/systems/ShipDesigns.js`: procedural silhouettes (delta/dart/wing/raider/hauler/oval)
  - Rendered larger (player ~1.6x; NPCs 1.35–1.6x by role) for a 16‑bit sprite feel
  - New `docs/js/systems/FactionVisuals.js`: generic faction palettes and simple decals; applied to player and NPCs

- Reputation scaffold
  - `state.reputation = { trader, patrol, pirate }` initialized and saved/loaded
  - Trader rep increments on buy (+1) and sell (+2 if profitable)
  - Patrol rep increments when the player kills pirates (+1)
  - Emits `GameEvents.REPUTATION_CHANGED` with `{ faction, delta, total }`

- Gameplay fixes
  - Respawn: Press R after death to respawn near nearest planet; clears incoming projectiles; applies small credit penalty
  - Trading: Prevent selling goods that a planet doesn’t buy; “No buyers” indicator and disabled button; prevents cargo loss/NaN credits
  - Cargo counter: Avoids NaN by treating items without `quantity` as 1

- HUD: Ship Radio
  - Compact radio player between left stats and center logo: prev, play/pause, next, volume below buttons, title above
  - Procedural ambient tracks (Drift / Pulse / Nebula) in `AudioSystem`
  - `state.audio.musicVolume` persists volume across tracks and sessions; Mute pauses radio

## Files Touched (Highlights)

- Planet visuals: `docs/js/systems/UISystem.js` (overlays, fade-in)
- Ships: `docs/js/systems/ShipDesigns.js`, `docs/js/systems/RenderSystem.js`
- Factions: `docs/js/systems/FactionVisuals.js`, `docs/js/main_eventbus_pure.js` (NPC/player faction assignment)
- Reputation: `docs/js/core/EventBus.js` (+REPUTATION_CHANGED); `docs/js/systems/TradingSystem.js`; `docs/js/main_eventbus_pure.js` (NPC_DEATH hook); `docs/js/systems/SaveSystemAdapterFixed.js` (persist)
- Respawn: `docs/js/main_eventbus_pure.js` (R key via INPUT_KEY_DOWN handler, `respawnPlayer()`)
- Trading fixes: `docs/js/systems/TradingSystem.js` (sell guards + cargo UI)
- Radio: `docs/index.html` (widget), `docs/css/main.css` (layout + slider), `docs/js/systems/AudioSystem.js` (music), `docs/js/systems/UISystem.js` (controls + state wiring), `docs/js/core/EventBus.js` (music events)

## How To Verify Quickly

- Landing visuals
  - Land on each planet. Observe scanline + pixel band briefly, then HQ image fade-in. No scrolling on landing overlay

- Controls
  - M (mute), Q/F (switch/fire), L (land), F5/F9/F12 (save/load/clear)
  - After death message, press R to respawn; verify credits penalty and clean spawn

- Trading
  - Buy two distinct goods on Planet A
  - Fly to a planet that buys only one of them; list shows both under “YOUR CARGO”; non-bought item shows “No buyers”; selling the supported item works; credits remain valid
  - Cargo HUD never shows NaN/10

- Radio
  - Start radio ▶, switch tracks ◄/►; volume persists across track changes and reloads; slider sits under buttons, title above

## Architecture Rules (unchanged)

- Active entry: `docs/js/main_eventbus_pure.js`
- Pure EventBus; state via `StateManager`; relative imports only; no ad-hoc globals

## Important Debug Toggles (console)

- Planet visuals inside `UISystem` instance:
  - `window.systems.ui.landscapeImageProvider = 'auto'|'unsplash'|'lexica'` (auto recommended)
  - `window.systems.ui.usePollinationsEnhance = false` (default)
  - `window.systems.ui.pollinationsHQOnly = false`
  - `window.systems.ui.pollinationsTimeoutMs = 12000`
  - `window.systems.ui.showProviderInfo = false` (set true for resolution overlay)

## Suggested Next Tasks

1) Ship combat dynamics and evasion routines
   - Weapon spread/recoil variants, heat/cooldown cadence
   - Simple NPC evasion (vector away from projectiles, strafe patterns), tie to faction personality

2) Performance polish
   - Pool/cull explosion particles in `RenderSystem` and projectile trails

3) Reputation effects (lightweight)
   - Minor discounts/markups (±2–5%) based on `trader` rep
   - Patrol hail if `patrol` rep high (message bubble), pirates taunt if low

4) Visuals
   - Faction decals on minimap dots + HUD target brackets
   - Radio: add a small scan/progress bar and channel labels

## Notes

- GitHub Pages build uses `/docs` directly. Avoid absolute imports. Keep landing overlay single-screen and non-scroll.
