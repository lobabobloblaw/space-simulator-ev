# ðŸŽ® Galaxy Trader - Session 34 Handoff Summary

## Your Mission
**Verify that the Pure EventBus refactor has 100% feature parity with the original game.**

## Quick Start
```bash
cd /Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/space-simulator-ev
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open localhost:8000/docs/ in browser
```

## The Two Versions
1. **NEW (Test This):** `/docs/index.html` - Pure EventBus architecture
2. **OLD (Reference):** `/docs/index_old_backup.html` - Original mixed architecture

## Priority Verification Areas

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL (Test First)
- Player starts with NO weapons (must buy at planet)
- All NPC types spawn and behave correctly
- Combat system works (damage, projectiles, death)
- Trading actually generates profit
- Save/Load preserves full game state

### ðŸŸ¡ IMPORTANT (Test Second)  
- All 4 weapon types function properly
- Engine upgrades increase speed
- Shield upgrades provide protection
- Mission system generates and completes tasks
- UI updates reflect all changes

### ðŸŸ¢ POLISH (Test Last)
- Particle effects render
- Sound effects play
- Screen shake on explosions
- Performance stays at 60 FPS
- No memory leaks over time

## The Refactoring Context
- Moved from mixed architecture to Pure EventBus pattern
- All systems now communicate via events only
- Should have ZERO functional differences from original
- Code is cleaner but gameplay must be identical

## Red Flags That Indicate Problems
- ðŸš¨ Player starts with a weapon (BUG - should start empty)
- ðŸš¨ NPCs missing or stuck
- ðŸš¨ Can't complete trades
- ðŸš¨ Upgrades don't apply
- ðŸš¨ Console errors during play
- ðŸš¨ Save/Load breaks

## Success Looks Like
âœ… Both versions play identically  
âœ… All features work in refactored version  
âœ… No console errors  
âœ… Stable 60 FPS  
âœ… Clean EventBus architecture maintained  

## Documentation Available
- `/SESSION_34_HANDOFF.md` - Comprehensive checklist
- `/QUICK_TEST_GUIDE.md` - Fast testing commands
- `/SESSION_33_HANDOFF.md` - Previous session's fixes

## Remember
The game is **already deployed** at https://lobabobloblaw.github.io/space-simulator-ev/
Any bugs you find and fix should be pushed to update the live version.

Good luck with the verification! The refactor is supposedly complete, but thorough testing will confirm this.
