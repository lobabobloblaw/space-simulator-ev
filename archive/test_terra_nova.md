# Terra Nova Consistency Test

## What Was Fixed
Terra Nova had inconsistent water/land ratios across different views:
- **Overworld**: Showed ~60% land, 40% water (incorrect)
- **AI Prompt**: Was excessively watery (100% ocean)
- **Description**: States "A lush oceanic world with floating cities"

## Changes Made
1. **Overworld Rendering** (`proceduralPlanetRenderer.js`):
   - Adjusted elevation shift from -0.25 to -0.45
   - Now generates ~75% water, 25% land masses
   - Matches the "oceanic world" description

2. **AI Landscape Prompt** (`allSystems.js`):
   - Changed from pure ocean view to floating cities on ocean
   - Balanced to show both water and futuristic structures
   - Emphasizes "floating cities" and "quantum bridges" from description

## How to Test
1. Start the game and fly to Terra Nova (blue planet at x:700, y:400)
2. **Overworld Check**: Planet should appear mostly blue with some landmasses
3. **Landing Check**: Press L when close to land
4. **AI Image Check**: Should show floating cities/platforms on ocean, not pure water

## Expected Results
- Overworld: Predominantly blue planet with ~25% visible land
- Landing Image: Futuristic floating cities above ocean water
- Both views should feel consistent with "oceanic world with floating cities"
