# QUICK SESSION PROMPT (Alternative - Shorter Version)

If you prefer a more concise prompt, use this instead:

I'm continuing work on Galaxy Trader, a 2D space game at `/Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/space-simulator-ev/`. 

The game is FULLY WORKING with pure EventBus architecture (no globals, all state in StateManager). It uses `main_eventbus_pure.js` NOT main.js.

To run: `python3 -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000/docs/`

Last session we fixed asteroid collision effects. Everything works now.

Read `SESSION_40_QUICK_START.md` for context.

What would you like help with today?
