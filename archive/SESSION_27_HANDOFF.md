# SESSION 27 HANDOFF - Pure EventBus State Initialization Fix

## Project: Galaxy Trader - Space Trading & Combat Game
**Date:** August 18, 2025
**Session Focus:** Fix Pure EventBus state initialization to eliminate window globals
**Current Status:** Hybrid EventBus WORKING, Pure EventBus BLOCKED by state issues

## Quick Start for Next Session
```bash
# 1. Read environment setup and current state
cat /Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/UNIVERSAL_PRIMER.txt
cat /Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/space-simulator-ev/SESSION_27_HANDOFF.md

# 2. Start local server
cd /Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/space-simulator-ev
python3 -m http.server 8000

# 3. Test current production (Hybrid EventBus - WORKS)
open http://localhost:8000/docs/

# 4. Test diagnostic page (shows Pure EventBus issues)
open http://localhost:8000/docs/pure-diagnostic.html

# 5. DO NOT COMMIT until Pure EventBus is fully working
```

## Current Architecture State

### What's Working: Hybrid EventBus ✅
- **File:** `/docs/js/main_eventbus.js`
- **Status:** DEPLOYED and WORKING
- **Features:** EventBus communication + window global bridging
- Uses StateManager for state but also sets window.ship, window.planets, etc.
- All systems work perfectly
- Currently in production at index.html

### What's Not Working: Pure EventBus ❌
- **File:** `/docs/js/main_eventbus_pure.js`
- **Status:** COMPLETE but has runtime errors
- **Problem:** State initialization incomplete - missing properties that systems expect
- All systems are actually EventBus-ready, just need correct state structure

## The Exact Problems Found

### 1. InputSystem Initialization Error
```
❌ Input failed: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'x')
```
**Cause:** InputSystem expects `state.input.mouse.x` but state only has `state.input.keys`

**Current state initialization:**
```javascript
state.input = {
    keys: new Set(),
    mouse: { x: 0, y: 0, pressed: false },  // This exists
    touch: { x: 0, y: 0, active: false }    // This exists
};
```

**But InputSystem.init() is failing** - need to debug why

### 2. Update Loop Errors
```
Update error in system: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'x')
```
**Cause:** Systems are looking for properties in different places

### 3. State Structure Mismatches

**WeaponSystem expects:**
- `state.keys` (not `state.input.keys`)
- `state.audioSystem` reference

**SpawnSystem expects:**
- Properly initialized arrays for entities

**UISystem expects:**
- Various DOM elements (these exist in index.html)

## Diagnostic Tool Created

**File:** `/docs/pure-diagnostic.html`
- Loads each module individually
- Shows exactly where failures occur
- Currently shows InputSystem fails but Physics and Render succeed
- Has minimal state setup for testing

## Required Fixes

### Fix 1: Complete State Initialization
In `/docs/js/main_eventbus_pure.js`, ensure ALL these properties exist:

```javascript
function initializeGameState() {
    const state = stateManager.state;
    
    // Ship - COMPLETE ✅
    state.ship = { /* current implementation is fine */ };
    
    // Camera - COMPLETE ✅
    state.camera = { x: 0, y: 0 };
    
    // Game meta - COMPLETE ✅
    state.paused = false;
    state.gameTime = 0;
    
    // Entities - COMPLETE ✅
    state.planets = planets;
    state.npcShips = [];
    state.asteroids = [];
    state.projectiles = [];
    state.explosions = [];
    state.warpEffects = [];
    state.pickups = [];
    state.stars = { far: [], mid: [], near: [] };
    
    // Mission system - COMPLETE ✅
    state.missionSystem = { active: null, completed: [], available: missions };
    
    // Spawn state - COMPLETE ✅
    state.npcSpawnState = { nextShipSpawn: Date.now() + 3000 };
    
    // Audio state - COMPLETE ✅
    state.audio = { enabled: true, masterVolume: 0.3 };
    
    // Input state - NEEDS VERIFICATION ⚠️
    state.input = {
        keys: new Set(),
        mouse: { x: 0, y: 0, pressed: false },
        touch: { x: 0, y: 0, active: false }
    };
    
    // ADD THESE COMPATIBILITY PROPERTIES:
    state.keys = state.input.keys;  // WeaponSystem looks here
    state.audioSystem = null;       // Will be set after systems init
    
    // Physics state - COMPLETE ✅
    state.physics = { entities: [], collisions: [] };
}
```

### Fix 2: Debug InputSystem.init()
The InputSystem is failing during init(). Check `/docs/js/systems/InputSystem.js`:

1. Find what it's trying to access in init()
2. It might be trying to set mouse position before state.input.mouse exists
3. Or it might be looking for window.game.camera

### Fix 3: Set audioSystem Reference
After systems are initialized:
```javascript
await initializeSystems();
// Add this line:
stateManager.state.audioSystem = systems.audio;
```

### Fix 4: Update Systems for Consistency
Some systems might still be checking for state in wrong places:

**Check these files for state access patterns:**
- `/docs/js/systems/WeaponSystem.js` - uses `state.keys` and `state.audioSystem`
- `/docs/js/systems/SpawnSystem.js` - should use `state.*` not `window.*`
- `/docs/js/systems/UISystem.js` - should use `state.*` not `window.*`
- `/docs/js/systems/AudioSystem.js` - should use `state.*` not `window.*`

## Testing Methodology

### Step 1: Fix State Initialization
1. Update `main_eventbus_pure.js` with complete state
2. Test with diagnostic page
3. Watch console for specific error messages

### Step 2: Test Each System
Use the diagnostic page to test systems individually:
```javascript
// In browser console at pure-diagnostic.html
window.pureState.ship.vy = -0.1;  // Test movement
window.pureEventBus.emit('test');  // Test events
```

### Step 3: Integration Test
Once diagnostic works, test in actual game:
1. Create `test-pure.html` that loads `main_eventbus_pure.js`
2. Test all controls: WASD, F, L, Q, S, O, M
3. Verify no window globals are being used

## Success Criteria

Pure EventBus is working when:
1. ✅ No errors in console
2. ✅ Ship moves with WASD
3. ✅ Weapons fire with F
4. ✅ Can land on planets with L
5. ✅ Save/Load works with S/O
6. ✅ `window.ship` is undefined (no globals)
7. ✅ All state accessed via `stateManager.state`

```

## Recommended Approach

1. **Start with diagnostic page** - Get it working there first
2. **Fix InputSystem.init()** - This is the first blocker
3. **Add missing state properties** - Especially compatibility ones
4. **Test incrementally** - One system at a time
5. **Don't touch Hybrid** - Keep it as fallback
6. **Test thoroughly** before replacing Hybrid in production

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT COMMIT** until Pure EventBus is 100% working
- The Hybrid EventBus is working perfectly - don't break it
- All systems are already using EventBus/StateManager properly
- The issue is ONLY incomplete state initialization
- SaveSystem filename is `saveSystem.js` (lowercase 's')

## Commands for Testing

```bash
# Terminal 1: Run server
cd /Users/alexvoigt/Documents/Claude/space-simulator-ev
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Browser: Test pages
open http://localhost:8000/docs/                  # Production (Hybrid)
open http://localhost:8000/docs/pure-diagnostic.html  # Diagnostic tool

# Browser Console: Debug commands
window.pureState                    # Check state structure
window.pureState.input              # Check input state
window.pureSystems                  # Check loaded systems
window.pureEventBus.emit('test')    # Test event system
```

## Final Goal

Get `/docs/js/main_eventbus_pure.js` working without ANY window globals, proving the EventBus architecture is fully decoupled and clean. Once working, it can replace the Hybrid version in production.
