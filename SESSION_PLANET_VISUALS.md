## Date: Current Session

### Features Added

   - Terra Nova: Ocean world with floating cities
   - Crimson Moon: Volcanic mining with lava flows
   - Ice World: Arctic research with aurora borealis
   - Mining Station: Industrial asteroid base
   - Continuous animation while landed
   - Cyberpunk scan line effects

### Bugs Fixed
1. **Respawn System**
   - Now clears all threats when respawning (NPCs, projectiles, explosions)
   - Consistent with landing behavior

2. **NPC Flee Behavior**
   - Fixed "fish-like" wiggling when fleeing
   - NPCs now commit to straight escape paths for 60 frames
   - Faster initial turn to align with escape vector

3. **UI Overlap**
   - Fixed notifications spawning on top of tutorial hints
   - Notifications now stack below hints with 60px offset
   - Proper z-index hierarchy (hints: 10000, notifications: 9999)

### Technical Notes
- All changes in `/docs/js/systems/allSystems.js` and `/docs/css/main.css`
- Git commits were initially sent to wrong terminal (Python server)
- Fixed by spawning new terminal window for git operations

### Files Modified
- `/docs/js/systems/allSystems.js` - Added drawPlanetVisual(), fixed respawn, fixed NPC fleeing
- `/docs/css/main.css` - Fixed notification positioning
- `/docs/js/main.js` - No changes needed (already imports drawPlanetVisual)
