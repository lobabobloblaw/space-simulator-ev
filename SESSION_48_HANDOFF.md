# Session 48 Handoff – Galaxy Trader

## Summary
This session focused on targeting polish, a new target cam viewport, and a robust tracker-based radio with a molded HUD experience.

## What We Shipped
- Targeting + Viewport
  - Unified X targeting: cycles through all ships (hostiles preferred previously, now full-cycle) with Shift+X to clear.
  - New center viewport bookends controls with minimap; shows live-rotating silhouette of selected ship and a direction wedge.
  - Transition polish: persistent ring and wedge during target switching; brief silhouette gap + fade-in; selection blip.
  - Auto-clear on NPC death/destroy.
- Radio
  - Tracker modules (MOD/XM/IT/S3M) supported via chiptune-3 (local) with CDN fallbacks and synth fallback.
  - Local playlist wired to `/music` CC0 modules; enabled all tracks.
  - Added 660ms tuning static between tracks; no text hints; no shuffle/loop.
  - UI: molded dial backplate; concentric ring alignment; tightened button bar; disabled click rings; removed signal bars.
- Stability
  - Fixed UISystem music-state binding bug.
  - Defensive null checks in target cam to avoid transient errors.

## How To Run
- Local server: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
- Open: `http://localhost:8000/docs/`
- Radio: Play/Pause (middle dot), Prev/Next (upper/lower dots). Expect 660ms tuning static between tracks.

## Key Files Touched
- Targeting/Viewport
  - `docs/js/systems/TargetingSystem.js`
  - `docs/js/systems/RenderSystem.js` (renderTargetCam, static, blip, transition)
  - `docs/index.html`, `docs/css/main.css` (HUD layout)
- Radio
  - `docs/js/systems/AudioSystem.js` (playlist, chiptune loader, tuning cue)
  - `docs/js/data/radioPlaylist.js` (enabled local tracks)
  - `docs/js/systems/UISystem.js` (music state binding; removed bars)

## Notes
- Tracker lib loading order: local `/chiptune-3` (ESM) → local vendor → CDNs → synth fallback.
- If chiptune fails, synth radio plays to avoid silence.

## Next Suggestions
- Targeting
  - Optional: viewport distance ring or faint grid (no text) for extra depth.
  - Optional: hostiles-only cycle via modifier.
- Radio
  - Optional: subtle ring flash curve tuning; alt tuning noise flavor.
  - Optional: crossfade between tracks (quick 150–250ms).
- Performance
  - Cache gradients for medium/high; explosion LOD by distance.
- UI polish
  - Micro-nudge dial/button bar alignment, if desired.

Handoff complete. Ready for Session 49.
